# Build directory

This folder contains the executables and some temporary files when the solution is built. In the folder `dist` you will find the executables. Folder `obj` contains the temporary compilation files.

If you don't see anything here, open the solution file (`/example/example.sln`) in Visual Studio 2013 and hit F7 (Build Solution).
